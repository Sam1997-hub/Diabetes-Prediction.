Diabetes Prediction
1.	Explored the data and realized the data set was imbalanced.Used SMOTE to rectify the imbalance.
2.	Used Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes & SVM to predict diabetes. This had an accuracy of 72% even after using Voting Ensemble.
3.	Random Forest gave us an accuracy of about 90.9% on the training data set.
4.	We went ahead with ANN and that gave us an accuracy of about 91.6%.The validation accuracy was about 74% in the same, this was lower than the testing accuracy but     better than the scores of the models above.
